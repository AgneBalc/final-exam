He can see a codebase once, spend an hour max and understand how to navigate through it immediately. We have projects in multiple programming languages and even though he has not worked with them he can easily get around. Now I know people will say 'but all languages share common patters'. Yes, it's true but the guy is able to go through a 3k line project (just one of the many microservices we have) he has never seen before in a language he has never seen before and find the issue in less than 2-3 hours. Also he is knowledge in all areas. DevOps, FE, BE, data analysis, security... it's insane. And on top of all of that our product is really big and complex and people have spend years working in this company and still have gaps yet he seems to pick everything up extremely fast and connect everything together. I really look up to him and admire him but I know he is a very rare case as no one else in my entire company comes even close to that. And he doesn't call himself by a fancy title like many other people do. He always says 'I'm just a developer' and is really extremely humble. And on top of all of that he is always open to help or teach others. I no longer want to become senior, tech lead or principle engineer but rather become someone like him one day.",

      "text": "APIs have been around for over 20 years, with 200 million currently in existence and 1.5 billion more to be built in the next 8 years. However, the process of designing, coding and testing APIs is still outdated. /nOur goal was to create a platform that empowers Product Managers to design APIs without requiring extensive knowledge of JSON or YAML. /nIn today's world, B2B integrations rely heavily on APIs, but existing tools are either too developer-centric or hosted solutions. /nWe believe there is potential for Product Management to lead integrations that matter for customers, users, and partners. However, product managers must work with various stakeholders who may not understand the nuances of API integration or value of data. It also takes multiple steps and significant time to go from ideation to implementation. /nWe were looking for a product that supports collaborative innovation, is intuitive for different stakeholders, has governance and standards, and is a modern API development platform. /nSince there was no such product, we developed Conektto: the API-First Design and Test Platform, empowering Product Managers to design APIs and collaborate with developers and testers to generate mock tests, test execution, test data, performance tests, and report results. /nOur free-format API designer allows Product Managers to create OpenAPI specs to communicate with Developers. Additionally, we plan to release composite/aggregate API design and GraphQL capabilities in the future. /nWe've even partnered with Microsoft PowerFx for OpenAI-based code generation. Try out our platform and share your feedback or suggestions! :)",

Now of course depending on your facial structure this may not suit you. Thankfully, there are many different ways you can style your hair in order to hide the fact it is rapidly thinning. For gray hairs I would recommend plucking them, as a 28 year old with gray hair may end up catching some odd looks now and then. If you're okay with this however, and they blend in nicely with your natural haircolor, you may be more inclined to keep them. If all else fails, you could always see about getting hair plugs, it seemed to work well for Elon Musk.",
